# DSA-final-project-decision-tree-2270
Final project turn in for data structure and algorithm 2270

## Data structure implemented
Decision Tree
In this project, I will use a tree-based structure to implement some decision tree algorithm for some risk modeling and decisioning problems. A decision tree is a representation of a data structure that consists of nodes and edges. 

## Explanation of the data structure
A decision tree can be a binary tree or generic(N-ary) tree. It always has one root node, and at each node, a test is executed which generates a decision that indicates which one of the child node should come next. A leaf node is a terminal node where no tests or decisions are made. It gives an outcome of the decision tree. An edge connects a parent node to its child nodes.

## How to run my project
If your project is something I can run, please give instructions on how to do that
If your project isn't something that I can run, show me what it does. You can take a video and upload it to YouTube or Vimeo or simply to a private Google drive link. Or if video isn't your thing, a document with screenshots and words explaining what's going on.
